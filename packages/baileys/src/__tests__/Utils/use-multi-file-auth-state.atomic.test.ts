/**
 * H7 — `useMultiFileAuthState` has no atomic writes and no corruption recovery.
 *
 * `writeFile` (use-multi-file-auth-state.ts:43) writes JSON in place. A crash
 * mid-write produces a truncated file. `readData` (line 50-66) catches every
 * error — `JSON.parse`, `EACCES`, `ENOSPC` — and returns `null`, which the
 * caller treats as "key absent." A crash mid-write of `creds.json` therefore
 * looks identical to a fresh install on next boot, producing silent identity
 * loss.
 *
 * Desired behavior:
 *   - persistent writes go to a `.tmp` file and rename atomically;
 *   - read distinguishes ENOENT (return null) from corruption (throw with
 *     diagnostic detail) so operators see the problem and can recover.
 *
 * Failing while H7 is unresolved. Flipped to `it(...)` in Stage 5.
